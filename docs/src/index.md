# [VecchiaMLE.jl documentation](@id Home)

## Overview

This package computes an approximate Cholesky factorization of a covariance matrix using a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach.
The Cholesky factor is computed via the Vecchia approximation, which is sparse and approximately banded, making it highly efficient for large-scale problems.
